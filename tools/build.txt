Short explanation of Maven/Tycho build system

Prerequisites:
* Java (at least 8, best in search path)
* Maven 3.1 or newer (best in search path)
* Lumira Designer installed

Before the first build you need ones to run tools/createP2RepoFromDS.bat.
It creates a so-called P2 Update site from a Lumira Designer or Design Studio.

Then you can simply run
mvn clean install
on the root of the Git project.

You find the installable update site in 
updatesite/target/updatesite-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip

This updatesite contains all features.
